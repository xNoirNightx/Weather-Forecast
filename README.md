# Weather-Forecast
6th Challenge , Using Server-Side APIs to make a weather dashboard.

## Description

I was tasked with my 6th challenge to make a weather dashboard.
- Learn how frusterating APIs are.
- Over 30 hours of problem solving and constant bug fixing. 
- Learned how to add inits.
- Working on condensing JS.
- Learned to work more with jQuery and Day.js

> **Note**: I need to work on my JS , I am relying heavily on the class material and googling way to many of my questions.
unlike with HTML and CSS I struggle with coding this smoothly and find myself getting frusterate more than enjoying it . I want to be
a sucessful full stack web develeper. I think I need to take a step back and practice more with weeks 4-6 and create more mini projects for practice. 

I followed the criteria below provided by the class instructors.

## User Story
